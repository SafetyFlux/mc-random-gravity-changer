# Gravity Changes Randomly
## General
With this data pack, your gravity will change to a random direction every 30 seconds. As the idea is fairly disruptive for normal gameplay, it's perfect for challenge runs. Since this is my first ever datapack, it's rough around the edges. I do plan to update it with new features when I have the time, though. Feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

If you feature this data pack in a video, I do ask that you link this page in your description. I want those who are interested in the idea to have the opportunity to try out my content!

## Dependencies

## Todo
- Create an icon for pack.png (and for this project page).
- Add screenshots to this project page.
- Add a check which verifies the correct mods are installed.
- Prevent the data pack from picking the same direction twice in a row.
- Add settings for the following:
  - Time between gravity changes.
  - Directions to include/exclude.
  - Whether all players shift to the same direction or not.
